# **The Anarchy Bounty System: A Scrum Framework Subclass**

## **Introduction**
The Anarchy Bounty System offers a decentralized approach to task management within our studio, engaging both internal and external contributors. This system turns tasks into "bounties" that contributors claim, fostering autonomy, aligning work with individual strengths, and creating a dynamic, engaged community.

## **Key Differences from Traditional Scrum**
Unlike traditional Scrum, where team members volunteer for tasks, the Bounty System emphasizes a decentralized approach. Here, a **Guild Master** posts tasks (or "bounties"), and contributors claim bounties based on personal interests and skills. This shift enhances engagement, ownership, and autonomy within our development process.

## **Setting Up the Bounty System**

### 1. **Contributor Onboarding**
   - **Structured Onboarding**: New contributors go through an initiation process, including basic “bounties” or checklists, to learn project workflows and the Bounty System.
   - **Entry-Level Tasks**: Initial tasks help contributors gain familiarity with the project and build confidence.
   - **Tiered Bounty Access**: Contributors progress through tiered access levels based on experience and quality, allowing structured growth and rewards for high-quality contributions.

### 2. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - **Guild Master**: Creates, categorizes, and posts bounties, assigning point values.
   - **Bounty Master**: Provides task updates, answers contributor questions, and negotiates points for complex bounties.
   - **Contributors**: Claim tasks that match their skills and propose new bounties where they see improvement opportunities.

### 3. **Creating and Posting Bounties**
   - **Step 1: Guild Master Preparation**
      - Identify project needs, define tasks, categorize by complexity, assign point values, and set deadlines.
      - Record all task details for transparency.
   - **Step 2: Bi-Weekly Bounty Board Posting**
      - Update the Bounty Board every two weeks to keep tasks current and visible.
      - Establish criteria for task complexity and scoring, ensuring transparency and fairness.
   - **Step 3: Dynamic Rewards and Leaderboard**
      - **Public Leaderboard**: Display top contributors and points to encourage friendly competition.
      - **Dynamic Rewards**: Contributors who consistently perform well receive bonus points and access to exclusive tasks.

   - **Bounty Master’s Role**: Answer questions, review progress, and help clarify points and task requirements as needed.
   - **Contributor’s Task Selection**: Contributors browse and select bounties that align with their skills and goals.

### **Midday Check-In: Execution and Support**
   - **Ongoing Development**: Contributors work on bounties, request support from the Bounty Master, and submit completed work to an automated testing tool for quality control.
   - **Contributor Progress Updates**: Contributors update task statuses and provide feedback, which helps refine the system over time.

### **Afternoon Wrap-Up: Review and Feedback**
   - **Guild Master Task Review**: Reviews completed tasks, allocates points, and updates the leaderboard.
   - **Community Voting**: Contributors can rate completed tasks, building a soft reputation system and influencing access to higher-tier bounties.
   - **Reflection and Collaboration**: Contributors reflect on tasks, propose new bounties, and participate in open community meetings for project updates and feedback.

### **Weekly Milestones: Review and System Refinement**
   - **Sprint Goal Assessment**: Guild and Bounty Masters review weekly progress, adjusting bounties to meet goals.
   - **System Feedback Loop**: Weekly surveys and forums collect contributor feedback, helping refine task clarity, points, and guidelines.
